# Prepare for ETHBerlin Zwei

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps.

## Communication Channels

Let's get in touch!

1. Connect with hackers on Riot: [#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org)
1. Connect with hackers on [StatusIM](https://status.im): `#buidlyourberlinteam`
1. Tag us on Twitter [@ETHBerlin](https://twitter.com/ETHBerlin) using the `#ETHBerlinZwei` hashtag.

## Getting to Berlin

On Berlin's [very own web presence](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.

Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. 

However, there is a limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [to us](mailto:joinus@ethberlin.com).

## Accommodation

There are a variety of accommodation options available in Berlin. From hostels to airbnb flats and hotels. We **recommend the districts Treptow, Kreuzberg, Neukölln, or Friedrichshain** due to their proximity to the venue.

Due to the regulations of the venue, unfortunately we cannot offer any sleeping facilities on-site, and **sleeping bags are not allowed**. Please make sure you take this into consideration when choosing an accomodation.

Again, this year, we have the _adopt-a-hacker_ programme available for people offering and seeking a couch in proximity to the venue. Read more about the programme on our blog: [Mass adoption comes in all shapes and sizes: Berlin — ADOPT A HACKER](https://medium.com/ethberlin/mass-adoption-comes-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-berlin-adopt-a-hacker-154205a0dc27)!

## Tickets

If you are a hacker, mentor, registered sponsor, volunteer, judge, or a speaker you don’t need a ticket, just your e-mail confirmation and ID.

DappCon and other Berlin Blockchain week tickets **are not valid** for the ETHBerlin hackathon.

Don't have a ticket? [Apply to hack here](https://ethberlin.typeform.com/to/Ol7zeq)! Or become a [volunteer](./volunteers.md)!

## Hackathon Schedule

On Friday (August 23rd) at 22:00 the opening ceremony accompanied by dinner and drinks, and team formation will take place. The Hackathon kicks off at midnight (00:00 on August 24th).

-   **Full Schedule** includes first-day conference tracks, workshops during the hackathon, etc.
