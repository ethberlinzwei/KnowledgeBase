# The Event

## Preparation and Planning

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps.

### Getting to Berlin

[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [to us](mailto:joinus@ethberlin.com).

### Accommodation

There are a variety of accommodation options available in Berlin. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their proximity to the venue.

Due to the regulations of the venue, unfortunately we cannot offer any sleeping facilities on-site, and
sleeping bags are not allowed. Please make sure you take this into consideration when choosing an accomodation.
