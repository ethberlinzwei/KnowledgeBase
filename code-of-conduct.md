# ETHBerlin Code of Conduct

We want to come together to exchange ideas, make new friends, and build things as an inclusive, welcoming, and safe community. Any harmful or discriminating behavior by anyone (hackers, speakers, judges, mentors, sponsors, volunteers, organizers, or other attendees) will not be tolerated and results in the offending person(s) being expelled from the event.

Hackers should be judged by their actions, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack thereof), or position.

## Be Open

Be welcoming to all. Especially welcome newcomers to the community. We all bring different backgrounds and experiences to hack and build things together. Great things can happen when we show up with an open mind and curiosity.

## Be Respectful

Be kind to others. Respect their work, time, and perspectives. Do not insult or put down other attendees. We all spend our time, resources, and energy to be part of this event. Respect each other and respect the #buidl.

## Try Things. Build Things. Together.

ETHBerlin is a hackathon. We hack and build. Dare to create something nobody did before. If you get stuck, ask for help - people will help you when you ask. This is a community event. We create things together.

## What We Build

Promote Decentralization. Don't litter other people's data. Make public data available, protect private data. Build what matters to you. You can create new applications, find/fix bugs & vulnerabilities, work on bounties, or help others during their hacking. You can create art and beauty on a computer. Most importantly, hack and build.

## Hacking Starts at ETHBerlin

Hacking starts during the event. Teams can form and ideas can evolve before the hackathon. However, the code base, hacks, and prototypes that you create for any apps competing for prizes or bounties need to evolve only during the hackathon. Apps, hacks, and projects that were built before the event do not qualify and will be excluded from judging and any prizes.

## Bugs & Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a bug or vulnerability, please submit a report to the appropriate team or project right away. Make a good faith effort not to access or destroy another user's data. Act for the common good through the prompt reporting of all found vulnerabilities. Never willfully exploit others without their permission.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcomed sexual attention.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a volunteer or organizer as soon as possible. If you can't find anyone in person, reach out via [email](mailto:joinus@ethberlin.com).

For additional details about what kinds of behavior are not tolerated, and the consequences of any misconduct we refer to the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/).
