# Prizes and Bounties

-   [Prizes on Devpost](https://ethberlin.devpost.com/)
-   [Bounties on Github](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties)

## Prizes

-   **Open Track Prize:** This is the main prize of ETHBerlin. There will be 10 winners. The grand bounty is of approximately TBD € and it’s distributed equally. You can calculate it ;)
-   **Sponsor Prizes:** Some of ETHBerlin’s sponsors have their own price awards. They can each pay out a maximum of TBD €. These prizes will be funded and distributed via Gitcoin. Note that ETHBerlin has no influence on neither the challenge nor the judging, this is entirely up to the sponsors. You can find all the prize awards [here](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties/issues).
-   **Community Improvement Awards:** These are small prizes endowed with TBD € each by ETHBerlin. Check them out [here](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties).

**IMPORTANT:** You can submit your work to multiple prize awards, they are not exclusive! For example you can submit your work to the open track bounty and a sponsor specific prize, just make sure to submit it everywhere where you want to participate.

## Submission Guidelines

-   Hacking starts during the event. Teams can form and ideas can evolve before the hackathon. But, the code base, hacks, and prototypes that you create for any apps competing for prizes or bounties need to evolve **only** during the hackathon. Apps, hacks, and projects that were built before the event do **not** qualify and will be excluded from judging and any prizes.
-   Teams should have a **maximum of 5 team members** consisting of registered hackers.
-   The project should have an open source license and what has been produced during the hackathon should be publicly available and accessible by judges and everyone else.
-   A short **presentation** file must describe your project. It has to be accessible without special tools. Ideally a PDF, Google slides, or even a hosted recording if you like. All the judges need to be able to access the presentations.
-   You need to provide a link which acts as an entry point to your project. Ideally, this link should be a public repository containing the code, team members, presentations and documentation on how someone can use your code.
-   Smart contracts must be deployed to a public testnet or the Ethereum mainnet.
-   Submission closes at 10:00 am on Sunday the 25th of August 2019.

### Submission of sponsored prizes

Each sponsored prize has a GitHub issue in the [bounties repository](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties). After you've decided which ones you want to apply for, go to the Gitcoin bounty associated with that prize, and click on "Start Work". At the end of judging, the sponsor will decide on a team, and pay out the bounty through Gitcoin.

These prizes are different from the Open Track prize and People's choice award.

## Judging

-   Submission closes at 11:30am on Sunday the 25th of August 2019.
-   Judging for the Open Track Prize will happen based on what was submitted via Devpost.
-   After your submission the judging team will check you met the submission guidlines and leave a comment on your GitHub repository. **Starting at around 12pm**
-   Judging will happen on the 3rd floor.
-   Each project will be judged by two different judging groups to reduce subjective opinion.
-   You will present your project to each judging group once. You will have 5 mins for a presentation/demo, and 2 mins for Q&A/Feedback.

Sponsored prizes are judged by the respective sponsor, and have different judging criteria. The ETHBerlin Judging team does not judge sponsor prizes!

## Commitment to Using Dapps

> If you liked it then you shoulda put a dApp on it!

ETHBerlin will try to use tools created within the ecosystem as much as possible for its needs.
This paves the way for adoption of web3, which we're all trying to buidl, and acts as a good
testing ground for the dapps, consequently helping the respective teams to learn from this experience
and make software even better.
