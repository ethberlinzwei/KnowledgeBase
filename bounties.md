# Prizes and Bounties

What a lame hackathon this could be without any prizes, bounties, and an incredible award ceremony. Fear no more, here's the prizes and bounties documentation.

## TL;DR

-   Review all the available [Prizes on Devpost](https://zwei.devpost.com/)
-   Find additional hackathon [Bounties on Github](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties)

## Prizes

This year, there are different prize categories available.

-   **Open Track Prize:** This is the main prize of ETHBerlin Zwei. There will be 10 winners. The grand bounty will be revealed soon!
-   **Sponsor Prizes:** Some of ETHBerlin’s sponsors have their own prize awards. Note that ETHBerlin Zwei has no influence on neither the challenge nor the judging, this is entirely up to the sponsors. You can find all the prize awards [here on Github](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties/issues).
-   **Community Improvement Awards:** These are small prizes endowed by ETHBerlin Zwei. Check them out [here](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties), more will be added in the next week.

You can submit your work to multiple prize awards, they are not exclusive! For example you can submit your work to the open track bounty and a sponsor specific prize, just make sure to submit it everywhere where you want to participate.

## Submission Guidelines

-   Hacking starts during the event. Teams can form and ideas can evolve before the hackathon. But, the code base, hacks, and prototypes that you create for any apps competing for prizes or bounties need to evolve **only during the hackathon**. Apps, hacks, and projects that were built before the event **do not qualify** and will be excluded from [judging](./judges.md) and any prizes.
-   Teams should have a **maximum of 5 team members** consisting of registered hackers.
-   The project should have an open source license and what has been produced during the hackathon should be publicly available and accessible by judges and everyone else, e.g., on Github or _Gitea_.
-   A short **presentation** file must describe your project. It has to be accessible without special tools. Ideally a PDF, Google slides, or even a hosted recording if you like. All the judges need to be able to access the presentations.
-   You need to provide a link which acts as an entry point to your project. Ideally, this link should be a public repository containing the code, team members, presentations and documentation on how someone can use your code.
-   Smart contracts must be deployed to a public testnet, i.e., [Görli](https://github.com/goerli/testnet) or the Ethereum mainnet.
-   Submission **closes at 10:00 am on Sunday** the 25th of August 2019.

### Submission of sponsored prizes

Each sponsored prize has a GitHub issue in the [bounties repository](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties). After you've decided which ones you want to apply for, go to the Gitcoin bounty associated with that prize, and click on _"Start Work"_. At the end of judging, the sponsor will decide on a team, and pay out the bounty.

These prizes are different from the Open Track prize and People's choice award.
