-   Judging will happen on the 3rd floor.
-   Each project will be judged by two different judging groups to reduce subjective opinion.
-   You will present your project to each judging group once. You will have finve minutes for a presentation/demo, and two mins for Q&A/Feedback.

[Sponsored prizes](./bounties.md) are judged by the respective sponsor, and have different judging criteria. The ETHBerlin Zwei judging team does not judge [sponsor](./sponsors.md) prizes!
