# Judges and Judging



## Judging

-   Submission closes at 11:30am on Sunday the 25th of August 2019.
-   Judging for the Open Track Prize will happen based on what was submitted via Devpost.
-   After your submission the judging team will check you met the submission guidlines and leave a comment on your GitHub repository. **Starting at around 12pm**
-   Judging will happen on the 3rd floor.
-   Each project will be judged by two different judging groups to reduce subjective opinion.
-   You will present your project to each judging group once. You will have 5 mins for a presentation/demo, and 2 mins for Q&A/Feedback.

Sponsored prizes are judged by the respective sponsor, and have different judging criteria. The ETHBerlin Judging team does not judge sponsor prizes!
