-   **Submission closes at 10:00am on Sunday** the 25th of August 2019.
-   Judging for the Open Track Prize will happen based on what was submitted via [Devpost](https://zwei.devpost.com/).
-   After your submission the judging team will check you met the submission guidlines and leave a comment on your GitHub repository, **starting at around 10am**.
-   Judging will happen on the 3rd floor.
-   Each project will be judged by two different judging groups to reduce subjective opinion.
-   You will present your project to each judging group once. You will have finve minutes for a presentation/demo, and two mins for Q&A/Feedback.

[Sponsored prizes](./bounties.md) are judged by the respective sponsor, and have different judging criteria. The ETHBerlin Zwei judging team does not judge [sponsor](./sponsors.md) prizes!
