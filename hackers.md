## Registration

If you are not already registered for the hackathon, [you can register here](https://ethberlin.typeform.com/to/Ol7zeq), or at the following locations and times.

-   During [dappcon](https://www.dappcon.io/) at their venue.
-   At the ETHBerlin venue (Factory Görlitzer Park) from 6pm on the 23rd August.

There's no need to register your team or idea upfront. Teams are registered when you submit to Devpost on Sunday (see more details below).

### Team building

**The team formation and hackathon kick-off will happen at midnight in Courtyard 1 (Food courtyard)**.

Don’t be shy. The community is open and everyone attending shares a passion for building open source technologies.

You can also visit the [hacker’s riot chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org) (#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org) and we have a [repository](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Find-A-Team) dedicated to hackers looking for teams, and teams looking for hackers. Consider it as a way to meet like-minded people and discuss building teams, however this does not replace the official team registration, which happens on the first day of the hackathon.
