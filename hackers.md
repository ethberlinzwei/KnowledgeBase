## Registration

If you are not already registered for the hackathon, [you can register here](https://ethberlin.typeform.com/to/Ol7zeq), or at the following locations and times.

-   During [DappCon](https://www.dappcon.io/) at their venue during the conference August 21st to 23rd.
-   At the [ETHBerlin Zwei](https://ethberlinzwei.com/) venue starting 18:00 on Friday, the August 23rd.

There's no need to register your team or idea upfront. Teams are registered when you submit to Devpost on Sunday.  See more details below.

## Team building

The team formation and hackathon kick-off will happen at midnight in Courtyard 1 where the food is. **Don’t be shy.** The community is open and everyone attending shares a passion for building open source technologies.

You can also:

- visit the [hacker’s riot chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org) (#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org)
- use the _find-a-team_ [repository](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Find-A-Team) dedicated to hackers looking for teams, and teams looking for hackers.

Consider it as a way to meet like-minded people and discuss building teams, however this does not replace the official team registration on Devpost!

**Once you have formed teams, sign up for ETHBerlin Zwei on Devpost** and submit your teams and projects: <https://zwei.devpost.com>
