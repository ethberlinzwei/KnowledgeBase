## The even is run by _you!_
First of all, thank you for supporting ETHBerlin Zwei, our community, and the whole ecosystem. Volunteering is an important role that makes these kind of events possible in the first place.

In order to prepare for the event and get up to speed, please read all awesome ETHBerlin material out there beforehand: [Medium](https://medium.com/ethberlin), [Website](http://ethberlinzwei.com) and [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/KnowledgeBase). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Code of Volunteer
_You are volunteering at ETHBerlin Zwei_, so your main focus is to support the organization of the event to ensure that our great hackers can buidl incredible things during these intense days. Of course there will be time and place for you to inhale the vibe, talk to other participants and enjoy the event. Pease do so! But keep in mind that supporting others and the ensuring a smooth experience for everybody will be your first priority during the event.

_Be available and welcoming_. As a volunteer, you are there to help. You agree to be available during your shifts to everybody who has a problem, needs information or help. Of course, sleep, eat, and rest :) But be available and friendly to everybody.

## Volunteer Sub-Roles
Below you can find the volunteer sub-roles which summarize all the tasks that need to be covered.
-   **Helpdesk & Registration**  answering general questions, checking the participants in, badge checkers for incoming attendees, being available at the front desk.
-   **Roaming Helpers & On-Site Checkers** are walking around the event making sure everyone is being helped, especially hackers, answering any questions inside the event and taking care of special rooms like the culture room, the mentor room, the judges room etc.

-   **Food** - We have organized with Factory all food-related stuff including the handout of food at all times and the restocking of drinks.
