## The event is run by _you!_
First of all, thank you for supporting ETHBerlin Zwei, our community, and the whole ecosystem. Volunteering is an important role that makes these kind of events possible in the first place.

In order to prepare for the event and get up to speed, please read all awesome ETHBerlin material out there beforehand: [Medium](https://medium.com/ethberlin), [Website](http://ethberlinzwei.com) and [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/KnowledgeBase). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Code of Volunteer
_You are volunteering at ETHBerlin Zwei_, so your main focus is to support the organization of the event to ensure that our great hackers can build incredible things during these intense days. Of course there will be time and place for you to inhale the vibe, talk to other participants and enjoy the event. Pease do so! But keep in mind that supporting others and the ensuring a smooth experience for everybody will be your first priority during the event.

_Be available and welcoming_. As a volunteer, you are there to help. You agree to be available during your shifts to everybody who has a problem, needs information or help. Of course, sleep, eat, and rest. :) But also be available and friendly to everybody.

## Volunteer Roles
