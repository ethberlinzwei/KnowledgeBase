# 3Box
**The best way to manage user data on the decentralized web!**

3Box is a secure and decentralized user data storage system. It's the easiest way for developers to build engaging, fully-featured web applications without needing to run a backend for handling user data. 

The [3Box JavaScript SDK](https://docs.3box.io/build/web-apps) provides easy-to-use [APIs](https://docs.3box.io/products) for identity, auth, profiles, storage, and messaging that help you build better apps, faster.

#### Why 3Box
- Build fully-featured dapps with less backend infrastructure
- Develop faster with easy-to-use APIs and tooling
- Reliable decentralized storage on IPFS and OrbitDB
- Improve security and privacy of user data
- Support data portability and interoperability
- Users don't need to install software
