# [Raiden](https://developer.raiden.network/)

The [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling low-fee and scalable payments. Raiden leverages payment channel technology, is complementary to Ethereum and works with any ERC20 token. 

A network of payment channels allows to securely transfer value off-chain, i.e without involving the blockchain for every transfer. Not involving the blockchain for every transfer helps avoiding the blockchain consensus bottleneck and makes transfers faster and cheaper.

A payment channel in Raiden is always backed by an on-chain deposit of tokens. When making a payment, the sender signs a balance proof to the respective receiver.

Raiden lets users pay anyone in the network by using a path of connected payment channels to mediate the payment.

## Getting Started

If you want to hack on Raiden during ETHBerlinZwei, please use the latest testnet Raiden release: [v.100.5 (GANDALF2000)](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/releases/tag/v0.100.5-dev0).

Make sure you have read the [requirements for safe usage](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview_and_guide.html#requirements-for-safe-usage) before proceeding. 

The easiest way to install and launch a Raiden node is using the [Raiden Wizard](https://medium.com/raiden-network/introducing-the-raiden-wizard-6c7c61c5b695). You can download the Raiden Wizard [here](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-installer/releases). 

Alternatively, you can manually install and launch Raiden:

0. Layer 1 required! You'll need a local (testnet) Ethereum node, either geth or parity, that is always synced and working reliably.
1. Download the Raiden Binaries for Linux or MacOS [here](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/releases/tag/v0.100.5-dev0).
2. Follow the [instructions](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview_and_guide.html#firing-it-up) to fire up Raiden.
