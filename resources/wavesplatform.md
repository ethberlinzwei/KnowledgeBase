## Resources

Main sources you will need for developing:

- [Waves Documentation](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/)
- [Waves GitHub](https://github.com/wavesplatform)
- [Waves Awesome](https://github.com/msmolyakov/awesome-waves)



#### Get started

First of all, you have to try the main instrument you will use for building dApps - **RIDE programming language**. Its [description](https://wavesplatform.com/products-ride) is available on the official website. The simplest way to get started coding on RIDE is by learning this [introduction](https://github.com/KardanovIR/ride-introduction). 
Moreover, you can read the [Quickstart article](https://blog.wavesplatform.com/how-to-build-deploy-and-test-a-waves-ride-dapp-785311f58c2) and build your first dApp. The needed development tools are also listed in this article in the **Tooling** section. 
Finally, you can observe the examples of using RIDE for dApps on [GitHub](https://github.com/wavesplatform/ride-examples/tree/master/ride4dapps).

After building a decentralised application you will have to create a user interface for it using [client libraries](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/getting-started/getting-started-for-developers.html#section-08a13db1866dad205a6e3ac4c69d02c4) - please choose some of the listed libraries that fit your skills the best for developing.
