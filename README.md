## The Hack?!? What is a hackathon?

There are different types of Hackathon, but the one at ETHBerlin Zwei has two purposes:

1.  Competing for sponsor prizes by incorporating their technologies into a project.
2.  Contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem with novel or amazing ideas, or contributing to existing projects.

## Help?!? But I've never been to a Hackathon before!

That's fine, you are most welcome here, everyone brings valuable skills to a hackathon. But we're sure you have some questions.

## Do I have to be a developer?

No! In fact, we **welcome anyone who brings different skills** to a hackathon. Wether you want to help as a designer, project manager, give UX advice, write documentation, or something else. Often the projects that do well at hackathons are the ones that focus on more than just code.
