## @TODO for this knowledge base 2019

-   [ ] I need help/mentoring/what's my level/what do you know?
-   [ ] Tips to be productive at a hackathon?
-   [ ] Examples of projects from before and previous winners, and lessons learned.
-   [ ] What is your role and what can you do to help, were there gaps from last year?
-   [ ] A hacker is x,y,z, or a glossary, be specific that it doesn't have to be a code, the Es needs different experiences.

## What is ETHBerlin

We assume if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but to recap.

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

Talks and workshops happen between the 21st and 22nd August as part of the [dapp conference](https://www.dappcon.io/) at **The Technical University of Berlin**.

The Hackathon takes place between the 23rd and 25g of August at **Factory Görlitzer Park, Lohmühlenstraße 65**.

It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

_This repository is information for those of you taking part in the hackathon_.

### What is a hackathon?

There are different types of Hackathon, but the one at ETHBerlin has two purposes:

1.  Competing for sponsor prizes by incorporating their technologies into a project.
2.  Contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem with novel or amazing ideas, or contributing to existing projects.

### Help! I've never been to a Hackathon before!

That's fine, you are most welcome here, everyone brings valuable skills to a hackathon. But we're sure you have some questions.

### Do I have to be a developer?

No! In fact, we welcome anyone who brings different skills to a hackathon. Wether you want to help as a designer, project manager, give UX advice, write documentation, or something else. Often the projects that do well at hackathons are the ones that focus on more than just code.

## Prizes and Bounties

-   [Prizes on Devpost](https://ethberlin.devpost.com/)
-   [Bounties on Github](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties)

-   **Open Track Prize:** This is the main prize of ETHBerlin. There will be 10 winners. The grand bounty is of approximately TBD € and it’s distributed equally. You can calculate it ;)
-   **Sponsor Prizes:** Some of ETHBerlin’s sponsors have their own price awards. They can each pay out a maximum of TBD €. These prizes will be funded and distributed via Gitcoin. Note that ETHBerlin has no influence on neither the challenge nor the judging, this is entirely up to the sponsors. You can find all the prize awards [here](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties/issues).
-   **Community Improvement Awards:** These are small prizes endowed with TBD € each by ETHBerlin. Check them out [here](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties).

**IMPORTANT:** You can submit your work to multiple prize awards, they are not exclusive! For example you can submit your work to the open track bounty and a sponsor specific prize, just make sure to submit it everywhere where you want to participate.

## Submission Guidelines

-   Hacking starts during the event. Teams can form and ideas can evolve before the hackathon. But, the code base, hacks, and prototypes that you create for any apps competing for prizes or bounties need to evolve **only** during the hackathon. Apps, hacks, and projects that were built before the event do **not** qualify and will be excluded from judging and any prizes.
-   Teams should have a **maximum of 5 team members** consisting of registered hackers.
-   The project should have an open source license and what has been produced during the hackathon should be publicly available and accessible by judges and everyone else.
-   A short **presentation** file must describe your project. It has to be accessible without special tools. Ideally a PDF, Google slides, or even a hosted recording if you like. All the judges need to be able to access the presentations.
-   You need to provide a link which acts as an entry point to your project. Ideally, this link should be a public repository containing the code, team members, presentations and documentation on how someone can use your code.
-   Smart contracts must be deployed to a public testnet or the Ethereum mainnet.
-   Submission closes at 10:00 am on Sunday the 25th of August 2019.

## Submission of sponsored prizes

Each sponsored prize has a GitHub issue in the [bounties repository](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/Bounties). After you've decided which ones you want to apply for, go to the Gitcoin bounty associated with that prize, and click on "Start Work". At the end of judging, the sponsor will decide on a team, and pay out the bounty through Gitcoin.

These prizes are different from the Open Track prize and People's choice award.

## Judging

-   Submission closes at 11:30am on Sunday the 25th of August 2019.
-   Judging for the Open Track Prize will happen based on what was submitted via Devpost.
-   After your submission the judging team will check you met the submission guidlines and leave a comment on your GitHub repository. **Starting at around 12pm**
-   Judging will happen on the 3rd floor.
-   Each project will be judged by two different judging groups to reduce subjective opinion.
-   You will present your project to each judging group once. You will have 5 mins for a presentation/demo, and 2 mins for Q&A/Feedback.

Sponsored prizes are judged by the respective sponsor, and have different judging criteria. The ETHBerlin Judging team does not judge sponsor prizes!

## Preparation and Planning

_For everyone_

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps.

### Getting to Berlin

[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [to us](mailto:joinus@ethberlin.com).

### Accommodation

There are a variety of accommodation options available in Berlin. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their proximity to the venue.

Due to the regulations of the venue, unfortunately we cannot offer any sleeping facilities on-site, and
sleeping bags are not allowed. Please make sure you take this into consideration when choosing an accomodation.

### Tickets

If you are a hacker, mentor, registered sponsor, volunteer, judge or a speaker you don’t need a ticket, just your e-mail confirmation and ID.

Dappcon and other Berlin Blockchain week tickets **are not valid** for the ETHBerlin hackathon.
