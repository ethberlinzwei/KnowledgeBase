## What is ETHBerlin

We assume if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but to recap.

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

Talks and workshops happen between the 21st and 22nd August as part of the [dapp conference](https://www.dappcon.io/) at **The Technical University of Berlin**.

The Hackathon takes place between the 23rd and 25g of August at **Factory Görlitzer Park, Lohmühlenstraße 65**.

It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

_This repository is information for those of you taking part in the hackathon_.

### What is a hackathon?

There are different types of Hackathon, but the one at ETHBerlin has two purposes:

1.  Competing for sponsor prizes by incorporating their technologies into a project.
2.  Contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem with novel or amazing ideas, or contributing to existing projects.

### Help! I've never been to a Hackathon before!

That's fine, you are most welcome here, everyone brings valuable skills to a hackathon. But we're sure you have some questions.

### Do I have to be a developer?

No! In fact, we welcome anyone who brings different skills to a hackathon. Wether you want to help as a designer, project manager, give UX advice, write documentation, or something else. Often the projects that do well at hackathons are the ones that focus on more than just code.
