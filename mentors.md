1. Spot them at the venue! They are usually wearing colorful shirts!
1. Discuss your issues in the [hackers channel on riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org), mentors will monitor it closely.
1. Post your question in our mentor system, `HELPq`. _The link will be available as-soon-as-possible(tm)._

# Mentors: Please read!

Thank you so much for helping our hackers as a mentor during ETHBerlin Zwei! Mentoring is an important part of the hackathon, you will help our hackers build the best things possible.

If you haven't done so, please read our [medium post](https://medium.com/ethberlin/so-you-think-you-can-mentor-280648923a0f) from last year on what it means to mentor.

### You are mentoring 1st and hacking 2nd

As a mentor, your main focus is to support other hackers and teams. If there is time and space to work on your own project, then by all means, please do. But keep in mind that supporting others is your first priority during the event. This way we can ensure that everyone gets the support they need.

### Be available and welcoming

As a mentor, you are there to help. You agree to be available throughout the whole event and welcome hackers and their questions free of judgement. Asking for help is not always easy, hackers who reach out to you with their problems count on you to help them. Of course, sleep, eat, and rest :) But be available.

### Be supportive but let the hackers do their own work

Hackers will look to you for guidance and support. You are there to help and guide but you are also there to let them build their project, not build it for them. Let them do their work and be as supportive as you can along the way.

## How to help

We encourage our hackers to all send in their requests for support the same way. We are using [HELPq](http://ehz.io/HELPq-data/) - a simple web-interface for hackers to submit a ticket to. All the mentors will have access to this ticket queue and be able to pull a ticket from.

You should have received login information in the welcome e-mail.

## Communications during the event

You will receive welcome e-mail with the link to our mentorship orga Riot chat. If you can't find it, please send your Riot handle to one of the mentorship leads. They will then add you to the channel.

## Mentorship On-Site Leads

We will be there over the weekend to support the mentors on-site if you have questions:

-   Philip
-   Caspar

If you have any questions along the way or can't access any of the mentorship-specific tools (our Riot chat or ticket system), please reach out!

For all the general event infos, please go to the [ETHBerlin Zwei website](https://ethberlinzwei.com) or continue reading the general [ETHBerlin Zwei Knowledge Base](https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/KnowledgeBase).
