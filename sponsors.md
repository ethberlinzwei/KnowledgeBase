# Sponsors

Thanks for sponsoring ETHBerlin!

ETHBerlin is excited to have the amazing Gitcoin team providing an easy way for you to contribute
to the main prize pool, or to sponsor projects that you find most promising.

## Overview

Gitcoin enables funding Github issues with any ERC20 token. You paste the Github issue into a form,
choose a token and quantity, and once the work is complete, you can payout the bounty with the click of a button. Furthermore, you can
contribute to existing bounties, and topping up the funds available to the issue. Read [this](https://gitcoin.co/funding/new)
quick explainer if you haven't funded an issue before.

## Hosting Special Prizes

If you want to host special prizes, you can create your own issue in the hackathon's repository, describing the prize
and judging/acceptance criteria, and then fund it through Gitcoin. To get an idea how the issue will look like
you can either have a look at the issue for the main prize pool, or [issues](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyHackathon/issues/42) created for the colony hackathon
after which ETHBerlin's funding is modeled.
