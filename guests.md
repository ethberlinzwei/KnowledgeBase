# Community Members and Guest Access

Attendance in the hackathon is limited to **participants only**: hackers, mentors, judges, speakers, and sponsors. This is to ensure that the teams will be able to focus on their projects. We ask you to understand and respect this.

_However_, this doesn't mean we don't have anything planned for you. On the contrary, there's a whole week of events planned around ETHBerlin Zwei for which we encourage you to checkout the satelite events of the [Berlin Blockchain Week](https://blockchainweek.berlin/).
